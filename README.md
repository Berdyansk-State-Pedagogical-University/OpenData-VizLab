# 📊 OpenData VizLab

*Open Data Visualization Lab for Education and Communities*

Berdiansk State Pedagogical University invites you to join the citizen science initiative **OpenData VizLab** to co-create a library of open data visualization examples for education, civic engagement, social projects, and community development.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of **OpenData VizLab** is to help educators, students, and all interested citizens develop basic skills in working with open data. We aim to show how even simple graphs and maps can make data more understandable and useful for society.

Participants will create and share their own examples of commented code and visualizations to demonstrate the potential of open data.

You don’t need to be a programmer or scientist – we welcome everyone who wants to learn how to work with open data or contribute simple examples!

## 📥 How to Participate

1. **Choose a dataset**  
   - Use the [Open Data Portal of Ukraine](https://data.gov.ua/) or other open data sources (e.g., [ecozagroza.gov.ua](https://ecozagroza.gov.ua), [ukrstat.gov.ua](https://ukrstat.gov.ua), [registry.edbo.gov.ua](https://registry.edbo.gov.ua/opendata/)).  
   - You can also use your own dataset that you think would be interesting to analyze and visualize.  

2. **Create a visualization**  
   - Use Python, R, or other tools designed for data visualization.  
   - Add a short description of what your work shows and why it might be useful to others.  

3. **Submit your example**  
   - Upload your file to this repository (see instructions in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md),
   - or [fill out the Google Form](https://forms.gle/t8oXFL8KVDFkXUAX8) and attach your files, 
   - or send your work to the project coordinators by [email](mailto:naukabdpu@gmail.com) 📧. In your email, be sure to include: your name(s) as author(s); code and/or visualization (as an attachment or link); the link to the dataset you used; a brief description of your work (what it shows and why it matters).  

4. **Become part of the open library**  
After review, your work will become part of the open collection of examples for education.

## 💡 Not sure where to start?

We have prepared several demo examples and [short guides](https://github.com/Berdyansk-State-Pedagogical-University/OpenData-VizLab/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).  

Got questions or unsure how to begin? – Write to us and we’ll help!

## 🏆 What’s Next

- The best works will enter a public vote on social networks.  
- Authors of the top three examples (based on votes) will receive certificates and acknowledgements from BSPU.  
- The library of examples will become an open resource for everyone working with data – educators, students, youth activists, NGOs, journalists, librarians, researchers, municipalities, and developers. It will help integrate open data into education, informal learning, analytics, civic engagement, and decision-making.  

## 📜 Submission Requirements

✅ Originality and accessibility (your work should be understandable even to beginners).  

✅ Formats:  
- Code or spreadsheet files: `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook), `.R` (R script), `.xlsx` (Excel).  
- Ready-made visualizations: images in `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`, `.pdf`.  

✅ **Important!** By submitting your work, you automatically agree that it will be published under the following open licenses:  
- **MIT License** for code (allowing others to freely use, modify, and share your code with attribution).  
- **Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY 4.0)** for charts and visualizations (allowing others to use your work with attribution).  

## 🧭 Example Visualization Ideas

- Air pollution in your city  
- Number of graduates by specialization  
- Map of shelter availability in schools or neighborhoods  
- How much your community spends on culture and sports  
- Data from weather stations or water temperature trends

## 🧩 Got your own data? That works too!  

You don’t have to use official portals – you can create your own small dataset and visualize it. For example:  

📦 How many plastic bottles do you throw away weekly? Build a chart and see what it looks like over a year.

🥗 How many vegetables do you eat during the week? Make a pie chart by type of product.

🚶‍♂️ How many steps or miles do you walk daily? Calculate the average or make a weekly diagram.

🧃 What do you drink daily – water, juice, tea? Count and compare with your friends.  

📚 Which books did you read this year? Create a chart by genre or reading time.  

## 📚 Inspiration Sources

Want to see how data can be visualized in creative ways? Explore these resources with hundreds of charts, maps, and diagrams on social, economic, and environmental topics:  

🌍 [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) – global data visualized as clear charts: climate change, education, health, and technology.  
📊 [Datawrapper River](https://river.datawrapper.de/) – a collection of live visualizations from media, researchers, and designers worldwide.  
🌐 [Gapminder Tools](https://gapminder.org/tools) – interactive charts showing how the world is changing: income, birth rates, life expectancy, water access, and more.  

Pick a topic you care about – and try creating something similar with your data or a local example!
